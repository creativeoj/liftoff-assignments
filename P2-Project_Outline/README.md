## Submission Instructions

### Overview
  My project will be Inventory Management System that will allow users to track food inventory by date, sell, and item. 
Users will be able to create an account, login, create, edit, and remove item.  
  I decide to make this project for my friend.  
She just opened pick-up food stations in different locations.  
She wants to track the each food item flow.  
This application can be beneficial for business owner for their products or item flows.  
And this application also is similar to stock management system.   I like to add more features to this application. 


### Features
-User Sign up: Users will be able to create a new profile for themselves, allowing them to track item flows. 
-User Login: Users will be able to login after creating a profile.  Password will be hashed, salted. 
-Edit, Create, and Delete items: Users will be able to create new items to track their item flows.  It will help to manage the entire item in the store
-View inventory by item: Users will be able to see an inventory 
-View inventory by date: The view by date will help to calculate write-offs for each category on a regular basis by date.

### Technologies
Java (POJO)
Spring-boot
Thymeleaf
Bootstrap for CSS and Javascript
IntelliJ Community Version
MySQL

### What I'll Have to Learn
I took C sharp track, when I took LC101 class. 
Self-study was little bit a pain, but I understand java, IntelliJ community version, and spring-boot.  
Through this project, I will learn more Java environments. 
And I dive deeper into from a public API, and add JavaScript for application.
