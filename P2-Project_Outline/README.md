To remove a menu, a user can simply click "remove menu" next to the add menu button.  
**if you remove a menu, all items of that menu will also be removed.

### What I'll Have to Learn
I took C sharp track in LC101 class. 
Self-study was little bit a pain, but I learn and understand java, IntelliJ community version, and spring-boot.  
Through this project, I will learn more Java environments. 
And I dive deeper into from a public API, and add JavaScript for this project.
